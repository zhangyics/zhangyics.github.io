I am a PhD candidate, supervised by [Prof. Xu Sun](https://xusun.org), at MOE Key Laboratory of Computational Linguistics, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University. My research interest is Natural Language Generation. Currently I'm working on the style transfer task.
